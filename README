Net::MySQL version 0.02
=======================

Net::MySQL - Pure Perl MySQL network protocol interface.

Net::MySQL is a Pure Perl client interface for the MySQL database.
This module implements network protool between server and client of
MySQL, thus you don't need external MySQL client library like
libmysqlclient for this module to work. It means this module enables
you to connect to MySQL server from some operation systems which MySQL
is not ported. How nifty!


OPERATING SYSTEM SUPPORTED BY 'Net::MySQL'

This module has been tested on these OSes.

   * MacOS 9.x with MacPerl 5.6.1r1
   * MacOS X with perl 5.6.0 build for darwin
   * Windows2000 with ActivePerl 5.6.1-build631
   * FreeBSD 3.4 with perl 5.6.1 build for i386-freebsd
   * FreeBSD 4.5 with perl 5.6.1 build for i386-freebsd
   * FreeBSD 4.0 with perl 5.005_03 build for i386-freebsd


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


If you use this by Perl older than 5.6.0, it is necessary to install
the latest I<Math::BigInt>. However, since the newest version of
I<Math::BigInt> distributed now has a possibility that it may not
operate correctly, you should install Math::BigInt version 1.49.

   <http://bloodgate.com/perl/>

I recommend you to use the newest Perl


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  IO::Socket::INET
  Math::BigInt

Since both are CORE Modules of Perl, there is no necessity for
installation.
